Since the node application works as the backend we will need to get the node server up and running.

Open the command line and go to the path of this project, run the npm install command in the terminal.
This will install all the dependencies and modules. Then navigate to the folder which contains the app.js file and run the command: node app.js This will start the application on port 2400.

Now our backend server is up and running.
