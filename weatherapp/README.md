After the backend server is up we need to start the Angular application.

First we will go to the project directory in the command line and run npm install command. This will install the different dependencies.

Then we will run ng serve which will run the angular application on port 4200 and can be accessed by http://localhost:4200.
This will launch the Weather application and from here we can search for any address and get the weather for that city, state or country.
